# oasislmf-get-model-testing
This repo generates fake test data and runs a ```get model``` process timing how long 
it takes to run the ```get model``` process for a specific data size. These are then 
plotted. 

## Running Tests 
This can be done by altering the number and size of datasets needed. We can then run the 
```main.py``` file to generate all the different datasets and run the models plotting 
the timings.

## Setting Up environment

write to stream in Python

the main function is the dfCdf func and goes through one loop

items giving the vulnerability for each area peril
